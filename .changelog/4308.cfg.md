Introducing the runtime mode

Instead of separately configuring various roles for a node, there is now a
single configuration flag called `runtime.mode` which enables the correct
roles as needed. It should be set to one of the following values:

- `none` (runtime support is disabled, only consensus layer is enabled)
- `compute` (node is participating as a runtime compute node for all the
  configured runtimes)
- `keymanager` (node is participating as a keymanager node)
- `client` (node is a stateful runtime client)
- `client-stateless` (node is a stateless runtime client and connects to
  remote nodes for any state queries)

Nodes that have so far been participating as compute nodes should set the mode
to `compute` and nodes that have been participating as clients for querying
and transaction submission should set it to `client`.

The following configuration flags have been removed:

- `worker.p2p.enabled` (now automatically set based on runtime mode)
- `worker.keymanager.enabled` (now set based on runtime mode)
- `worker.storage.enabled` (no longer needed)
- `worker.storage.root_cache.apply_lock_lru_slots` (no longer needed)
