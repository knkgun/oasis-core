# Metrics

`oasis-node` can report a number of metrics to Prometheus server. By default,
no metrics are collected and reported. There is one way to enable metrics
reporting:

* *Pull mode* listens on given address and waits for Prometheus to scrape the
  metrics.

## Configuring `oasis-node` in Pull Mode

To run `oasis-node` in *pull mode* set flag `--metrics.mode pull` and provide
the listen address with `--metrics.address`. For example

```
oasis-node --metrics.mode pull --metrics.address localhost:3000
```

Then, add the following segment to your `prometheus.yml` and restart
Prometheus:

```yaml
  - job_name : 'oasis-node'

    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
```

## Metrics Reported by `oasis-node`

`oasis-node` reports metrics starting with `oasis_`.
